# 🌌 İrem Kızıltepe | Geomatics Engineer Portfolio

This project serves as the professional digital portfolio of **İrem Kızıltepe**,  
a senior *Geomatics Engineering* student at Hacettepe University.  
It showcases academic background, GIS and Remote Sensing projects,  
and an interactive **Travel Distance Calculator** built with Leaflet.js.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The portfolio aims to combine technical engineering skills with design aesthetics.  
It includes independent pages for *About, Experience, Travel, and Contact* sections,  
each designed to reflect both scientific and creative aspects of geomatics.

The “Travel Distance Calculator” page allows users to:
- Select two locations on the map 🗺️  
- Calculate **distance, flight & drive durations, and time difference**  
- Display a ✈️ moving plane animation between selected points  
- Switch between **Map / Satellite** base layers

## 🧠 Development Note

This project was created and tested locally on **VS Code**,  
then deployed to **GitHub Pages** using manual HTML / CSS / JS structure.  

The focus was on:
- Optimized loading performance  
- Readability and accessibility across all devices  
- Aesthetic harmony between portfolio visuals and engineering content  

All map-related functions were implemented in **pure JavaScript**,  
including asynchronous API requests to OpenStreetMap for geocoding.
